Click on each book cover for my tiny summary and detailed notes(highlights) for each book. 


<!-- # 2022 -->

<!-- 

Put the newer one on top so that it will be in the same order as the Goodreads order. 

Read before 2022
----------------
Currently, two issues: 1) I don't see the static link for all books beyond the first 20 books; 2) Not sure how to display different years in this page. 

For issue 1). I can copy paste the link in the javascript part to get the complete list and save it to _notes.html. use print() in python to clean those escape strings. Save it to _notes_processed.html. Now I can use it to get all the books I want. Replace the picture size to the one used here: _S\w\d\d_ -> _SX98_
