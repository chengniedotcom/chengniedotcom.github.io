## *1984* - by George Orwell

Read: 2022-07-06

Recommend: 10/10

The book was published in 1949, portraying what life in a totalitarian country would be like in 1984. Only through reading this cautionary tale that I understand a few governments better. What was described in the book has become realities in a few countries: mass surveillance, repressive regimentation of people, a cult of personality, and a Ministry of Truth. George Orwell's language vividly captures some very interesting memes:

- Big brother is watching you. 
- The party's three slogans
    - War is peace
    - Freedom is slavery
    - Ignorance is strength
- Thought Police: the secret police who discover and punish thoughtcrime. 
- Doublethink: simultaneously accepting two conflicting beliefs about truths. 
- 2+2 = 5: a Soviet Union slogan from the second five-year plan, which encouraged fulfillment of the five-year plan in four years (1929-1932)
