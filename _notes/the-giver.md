## Notes

**Here are some text that I highlighted in the book:** 

1. This job has aged me.

1. Please ask any questions that will help you.

1. The experience explained itself to him.

1. The man nodded, encouraging his question.

1. If everything's the same, then there aren't any choices! I want to wake up in the morning and decide things!

1. We really have to protect people from wrong choices.

1. They have never known pain,he thought. The realization made him feel desperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg.

1. I used my wisdom, from the memories. I knew that there had been times in the past-terrible times-when people had destroyed others in haste, in fear, and had brought about their own destruction.

1. everyone would be burdened and pained. They don't want that. And that's the real reason The Receiver is so vital to them, and so honored. They selected me-and you-to lift that burden from themselves.

1. Jonas did not want to go back. He didn't want the memories, didn't want the honor, didn't want the wisdom, didn't want the pain. He wanted his childhood again, his scraped knees and ball games.

1. Feelings are not part of the life she's learned.

1. The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.

1. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.

1. All of it was new to him. After a life of Sameness and predictability, he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the road.

1. If he had stayed, he would have starved in other ways. He would have lived a life hungry for feelings, for color, for love.

1. But there was no purpose in if-onlys. His entire concentration now had to be on moving his feet, warming Gabriel and himself, and going forward.
