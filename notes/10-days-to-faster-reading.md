## *10 Days to Faster Reading* - by The Princeton Language Institute

Read: 2021-12-29

Recommend: 6/10

Two lessons: 1) Skip without guilt; 2) Preview. 

## Notes

**Here are some text that I highlighted in the book:** 

1. So take your white card and place it on top of the lines you read, leaving the lane open where you are going. 

1. Place the index finger of your left hand at the beginning of the line and the index finger of your right hand at the end of the same line. Your fingers are now framing the line of text.

1. Reading directly from beginning to end is not always the most effective or efficient way to read any material. Instead, before you read, quickly look for important clues that help you build background knowledge and establish your reading roadmap.Â 

1. Pre-view everything!

1. Overcome your fear of missing material. There is more than enough reading material to last a lifetime and your job is to q-u-i-c-k-l-y find what is most valuable to you.

1. I will always know my purpose and responsibility before I begin to read.

1. I will be able to skip information without guilt.

1. I will avoid marathon reading sessions by taking short, frequent breaks

1. The road to knowledge begins with the turn of a page.
