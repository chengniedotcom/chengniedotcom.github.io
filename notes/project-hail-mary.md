## *Project Hail Mary* - by Andy Weir

Read: 2022-03-06

Recommend: 10/10

I picked up this book because I saw Bill Gates' [recommendation](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Project-Hail-Mary). It is a great novel and the audiobook narrator, [Ray Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Porter), did a fantastic job of portraying those different people, including aliens, with various accents. Now I want to listen to the other audiobooks that Ray Porter did. Also, I'll be in the movie theater for Project Hail Mary once it is available.
