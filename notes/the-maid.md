## *The Maid* - by Nita Prose

Read: 2023-04-05

Recommend: 9/10

The narrator Lauren Ambrose is phenomenal. By skillfully altering her voice, she brings various characters to life right before my eyes. Though it's a book, it conjures a vivid mental movie through the author's detailed descriptions. The author Nita Prose may possess a positive form of OCD, which enables her to capture intricate details that create a sense of realism.

## Notes

**Here are some text that I highlighted in the book:** 

1. This is a bad thought, an unwelcome thought. I see Wilbur’s face flash in my mind and I have a sudden desire to punch it. But you can’t punch a thought. Or if you can, it does little to change reality.

1. As I pass, I take one glance back and see all eyes tracking my departure.

1. They have all put their faith in me. They believe in me. The only one who isn’t sure is me.

1. I knew she was in great pain, though she took great pains to deny it.

1. I looked at Gran through my tears.

1. I steadied my gaze and my voice. I concentrated my mind on the pleasant sound of my own blood. I could hear it in my ears, the rushing flow, in and out, rolling waves on a faraway beach. 

1. We are all the same in different ways.

1. “Do you ever feel like the world is backward? Like the villains prosper and the good suffer?”

1. he falls asleep before his head hits the pillow. 

1. Everything will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.
