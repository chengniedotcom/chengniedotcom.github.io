## *The Terminal List* - by Jack Carr

Read: 2022-03-15

Recommend: 5/10

I picked up this novel because [Ray Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Porter) read it. Ray did a fantastic job in reading the Project Hail Mary. He did a good job of reading this book too. The novel has a few interesting cliffhangers, but it is not as exciting as expected.
