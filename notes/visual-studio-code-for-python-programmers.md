## *Visual Studio Code for Python Programmers* - by April Speight

Read: 2022-07-06

Recommend: 5/10

I know I am not using VS Code to its full potential. That's why I picked up this book. It's a good refresher about some features I already know, like vim keymap and terminal. I also learned quite a few new things:

1. Run the python code with Conda virtual environment within the editor;
1. Refactor to extract variables and methods. 
1. Use the outline view in Explorer to get a table of contents for rst, md, and ipynb files
1. Use log point instead of print to debug 
1. View and filter data frame in Jupyter notebook
1. Debug cell in Jupyter notebook. I used to use ``from IPython.core.debugger import set_trace`` and then use ``set_trace()`` as a breakpoint to debug in cells
1. Git and Github integration

The book is a good refresher about many cool features that VS Code has. There are many typos and unclear sentences in this book's first version. Hopefully, it will improve in future iterations.
