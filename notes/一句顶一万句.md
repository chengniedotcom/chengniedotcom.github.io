## *一句顶一万句* - by 刘震云

Read: 2024-06-21

Recommend: 4/10

There are too many characters for me to keep track of, and I felt a bit lost towards the end of the book. However, there were a few sentences that made me laugh.


## Notes

**Here are some text that I highlighted in the book:** 

1. 蔡宝林讲理是自个儿讲，不让别人讲，好用自个儿的理把别人讲通；老秦讲理自个儿从来不讲，都是让人讲

1. 不求人办事是熟人，一求人办事人就生了

1. 有活儿干就不能叫累，没活儿干等活儿的时候，才叫累

1. 人要一赌上气，就忘记了事情的初衷；只想能气着别人，忘记也耽误了自己。

1. 模样，脾气，相互是否说得来，单讲一条遍地都是，几样凑到一起就难了。

1. 但大家知道，当十年省长，家产仅存千万，算是省长中最廉洁的了；
