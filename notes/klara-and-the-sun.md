## *Klara and the Sun* - by Kazuo Ishiguro

Read: 2022-07-01

Recommend: 7/10

I was very worried a few times the kids in the party might damage her as they were testing whether Klara is smart and robust. I was quite worried that Josie would die and Klara had to take Josie's place. None of those worries happened in the story, but the suspension Kazuo created was quite entertaining. It keeps me guessing what is going to happen next. If I was given a chance, I might choose to have an AF (Artifical Friend) as well. I like dogs, but I am allergic to them. An AF might be a good campanion without allergy and other issues like the work of walking a dog each day.
