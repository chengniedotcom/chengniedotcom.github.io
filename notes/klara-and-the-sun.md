## *Klara and the Sun* - by Kazuo Ishiguro

Read: 2022-07-01

Recommend: 7/10

I was worried a few times: the kids at the party might damage her as they tested whether Klara was smart and robust. I was worried that Josie would die and Klara would have to take Josie's place. None of those worries happened in the story, but the suspension Kazuo created was quite entertaining. It keeps me guessing what is going to happen next. If given a chance, I might also choose to have an AF (Artificial Friend). I like dogs, but I am allergic to them. An AF might be a good companion without causing allergies and other issues like the work of walking a dog each day.
