Recommend: 6/10

It was an entertaining story with an interestin quote: "You don’t stop running because you get old, you get old because you stop running". 

## Notes

**Here are some text that I highlighted in the book:** 

1. There’s something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we’re scared, we run when we’re ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.

1. So why should every other mammal on the planet be able to depend on its legs except us? 

1. Make friends with pain, and you will never be alone.

1. instead of cringing from fatigue, you embrace it. You refuse to let it go. You get to know it so well, you’re not afraid of it anymore.

1. talks about exhaustion as if it’s a playful pet. “I love the Beast,” she says. “I actually look forward to the Beast showing up, because every time he does, I handle him better. I get him more under control.” Once the Beast arrives, Lisa knows what she has to deal with and can get down to work. 

1. Until 1972, when the modern athletic shoe was invented by Nike, people ran in very thin-soled shoes, had strong feet, and had much lower incidence of knee injuries.”

1. In fact, there’s no evidence that running shoes are any help at all in injury prevention.

1. “That comes from never running in shoes until you’re seventeen.”

1. So who are these lucky few with well-evolved feet? Come to think of it, nobody: “Nature has not yet published her plan for the perfect modern runner’s foot,” Dr. Weisenfeld writes. “Until the perfect foot comes along, my experience has shown me that we’ve all got an excellent chance at having some kind of injury.”

1. Nike doesn’t earn $17 billion a year by letting the Barefoot Teds of the world set the trends.

1. For every other sport, lessons are fundamental; you don’t go out and start slashing away with a golf club or sliding down a mountain on skis until someone takes you through the steps and teaches you proper form. If not, inefficiency is guaranteed and injury is inevitable. “Running is the same way,” 

1. You don’t stop running because you get old, the Dipsea Demon always said. You get old because you stop running….

1. To be a great athlete, you need to pick your parents wisely. To survive as a writer, you should do likewise with your family. 

1. “No, thanks,” he decided. “I don’t want anyone to do anything except come run, party, dance, eat, and hang with us. Running isn’t about making people buy stuff. Running should be free, man.”
