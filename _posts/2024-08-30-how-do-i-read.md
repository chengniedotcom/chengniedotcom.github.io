TL;DR (Too long; Didn't read) version: audiobook

No matter what I’m doing–driving, running, or watching my kids at the playground–I am usually listening to an audiobook. This habit allows me to multitask efficiently, ensuring that I am always learning, even when I am on the move.

# Why do I read?

Reading for me is about growth and learning—whether it’s personal development like running faster, professional skills like writting better research papers, or understanding others better. 

[Yang Jiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Jiang) once wrote: "Your problem is worrying too much, but reading too little." I aim to never fall into that trap of reading too little. 

# What do I read?

There are a few sources I use to find the next read. 

1. [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books) wrote about the books he read from time to time. I had read many great books follwoing his recommendations including [Project Hail Mary](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Project-Hail-Mary) and [Educated](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Educated)
2. [Goodreads choice Award](https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2023). According to the website, it is the "only major book awards decided by readers". I have voted for a few books before. My favorite category is *Memoir & Autobiography*. 
3. Peer Recommendations. For example, I have interviewed my [high-school](https://chengnie.com/highschool2020/) and [undergraduate](https://chengnie.com/hust2023/) classmates and ask them what books they recommended. 
4. Douban's Yearly List. Similar to Goodreads, Douban provides [a curated list of Chinese books](https://book.douban.com/annual/2023/) across various catogoris.
5. Inter-book References. Sometimes one book leads to another, creating a chain of learning and discovery. I found [I don't want to talk about it](https://www.chengnie.com/notes/i-dont-want-to-talk-about-it) from another book [outlive](https://www.chengnie.com/notes/outlive).

# How do I read?

Stephen King wrote in his memior [On Writing](https://chengnie.com/notes/on-writing): "Waiting rooms were made for books"–a sentiment that applies well to audiobooks. Here’s how I my workflow of reading:

## Listening to the audiobook

- **Apps**: I rely on Audible, YouTube (using tools like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download the audio files), and Himalaya for my listening needs. For local files, the Castro App lets me play audio directly from my Apple Watch without needing my iPhone.
- **Devices**: My iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, paired with AirPods Pro, make an efficient setup for listening anywhere, anytime.

## Taking notes

I prefer eBooks for a simple reason: note-taking and revisiting content are easier. Here’s my process:

- **Apps**: I use Calibre and Kindle for eBook reading and note-taking.
- **Voice Memos and Reminders**: When running or driving, I use voice memos on my Apple Watch or iPhone to record thoughts and reminders for later review.


## Publishing notes

I publish [my notes online](https://chengnie.com/notes) to stay motivated and keep a handy reference for myself. It also allows me to share insights, like memorable quotes from books like [this one about time management #123](https://chengnie.com/notes/four-thousand-weeks#:~:text=The%20average%20human,gloriously%20possible%20instead). I have not cleaned the notes from many books that I read before 2021, yet. 

## Keepng lists

Maintaining a list of books to read and those I’ve read keeps me motivated. Participating in reading challenges since 2016, I’ve gradually increased my annual goal from 12 books in 2016 to [52 this year](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/47883724).
