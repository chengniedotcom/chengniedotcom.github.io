I run for the dopamine rush and the health benefits. 

We pursue many activities for the dopamine rush—food, sex, adventure, and more. Unfortunately, not all dopamine-inducing habits are healthy; some, like casual hookups, alcohol, drugs, and pornography, can lead to negative outcomes. That’s why I choose exercise for a healthier dopamine boost.

Among the many forms of exercise—bodybuilding, basketball, swimming, cycling—why do I choose running? The simplicity of running appeals to me: it requires minimal equipment and can be done almost anywhere. Consider Nelson Mandela, who maintained his mental and physical health through stationary running in his prison cell for almost 30 years.

I had a post from 2018 detailing how I started with 5K daily runs at the beginning of 2017 and ended that year with my first marathon at the New Year's Double Marathon in Allen, Texas. Here is a link to that post: [从5千米到马拉松.](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LVXI8vCoxx3b1XmB7oaWYg)

I began running regularly in December 2016, during an extra year of my PhD program. Anticipating the stress of job hunting, I used the Apple Watch and Nike Run Club App to track my runs, later switching to Strava. After about four months of daily 5K runs, I entered my first race with the Dallas Running Club and won third place in my age group—a very proud moment captured in a photo below.

## Lessons from Running: Plan, Persistence, Patience

Running has taught me plan, persistence, and patience. 

### Plan

My plans to break personal records started simple: run a 5K daily. As I progressed to longer distances, the daily 5K was no longer sufficient. A standout resource has been a book called *Daniels' Running Formula* written by Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels, in addition to being the name of a coach known for expertise in running, is also acknowledged as one of the most esteemed whisky brands. As joked about among readers, I run under the influence of Jack Daniels. His "2Q" training—two quality workouts per week, like a 15-mile speed run on Tuesday and a 25-mile long run on Saturday. For the remaining five days in the week, you can determine the quantity and pace at which you wish to run. 

### Persistence

Like many things in life, achieving success often requires consistent effort. This principle was ingrained from the start of my running routine. My initial goal was simple: to run 5K every day. This daily commitment not only gave structure to my everyday routine, but it also taught me the value of maintain a steadfast approach. Choosing to run every morning, whenever possible, not only ensured I completed my daily workout, but also provided a sense of tranquility to start my day. Moreover, this commitment to daily small tasks trained my mind to approach larger goals gradually and methodically, building up the ability to run marathons.

### Patience

Racing is a part of training. Not every race will be a personal best. These experiences, when outcomes do not align with my expectations or plans, instill in me the virtue of patience. For instance, I previously struggled with a significant issue related to long-distance running, namely, pain on the side of the knee due to iliotibial (IT) band syndrome. At the time, I was unaware of the cause; however, numerous hours spent in physical therapy educated me about the connection between this pain and weak gluteal muscles. 

Hence, I diligently incorporated gluteal muscle strengthening exercises into my daily workout routine to fortify these muscles so they could withstand the demands of a full marathon. Furthermore, I occasionally experienced various types of discomfort in other parts of my body including my foot, ankle, knee, and back. Through gradual learning, I discovered the significance of regular stretching and strength training and subsequently integrated these practices into my training regimen as well. 

These adjustments and continual learning have facilitated my recovery from numerous minor and major injuries, hence allowing me to continually improve my performance over time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Many individuals have posed various questions to me concerning the topic of running. Here are some of them and my answers. 

1\. What gear do I use for running?

As of January 2025, I prefer Brooks Adrenaline for training and Saucony Endorphin Elite for racing. I wear US size 10 shoes. My go-to socks are Injinji toesocks, and I use a Coros Pace 2, POD 2, and their arm heart rate for tracking. To stay entertained, I listen to audiobooks or music with my Apple Watch and AirPods Pro.

2\. What do I think about while running?

Initially, I can consume audiobooks or podcasts. After about one hour when my concentration wanes, I switch to music to maintain a fast pace.

3\. Why run marathons?  

Marathon training aids in maintaining my motivation. Enrolling in a marathon also provides a future event to look forward to.

**Marathons races I ran as of February 1st 2025.**

4\. Does running hurt your knees?

This reminds me of an exchange I once had with a relative of mine, whom I'll refer to as B. 

>> **B:** Running is bad to your knees.<br>
>> **Me:** I know. But what other exercises can I do?<br>
>> **B:** Swimming. Swimming is better to your knees.<br>
>> **Me:** I know. Do you swim?<br>
>> **B:** No.<br>
>> **Me:** Do you run?<br>
>> **B:** No.<br>
>> **Me:** Do you exercise?<br>
>> **B:** No.<br>

While running can strain knees, risks can be mitigated by managing body weight, training intensity, and posture. Starting with smaller goals and learning from injuries can help you enjoy long-distance running without pain.

5\. How do you find time to train? I am too busy with kids, work, life in general. 

How much time do you spend on entertainment? I use the time you spend on entertainment—TikTok, X, Instagram, TV, YouTube—for running. Many productive people are long-distance runners: Alan Turing, [Xi Yin from Harvard](https://hetg.physics.harvard.edu/people/xi-yin), Bryan Cranston, Charles Zhang, Malcolm Gladwell, Mark Zuckerberg, Haruki Murakami, Shi Yigong, and Zhong Nanshan.

6\. How can you keep on running?

I can keep on doing it because I have a small goal. My goal was to run 5K per day. For you, the small goal might have to be 100 meters per day or 10K per day depending on your body. Signing up for marathons and engaging with interesting audiobooks and podcasts during runs also keep me motivated.
