# Chicago Marathon 2025 🏅

On October 12, 2025, I completed the Chicago Marathon. The race tested not only my physical endurance but also my mental resilience and race strategy. Here are my reflections on what went well, what I can improve, and the memorable moments along the way.

## What Went Well ✅

### Race Results ⏱️

I ran 2:40:51—my second-fastest marathon so far. I placed around 781 out of 50K+ participants and ranked #6 among all Chinese runners.

### Injury Management 🩹

My left hip flexor held up throughout the race, which was my biggest concern going in. Despite some tightness at the start, I used two Biofreeze patches the day before and iced for 30 minutes around 5 AM on race day. I'm grateful I didn’t bring Celebrex (an NSAID)—masking pain could have worsened the injury.

I had two race plans: Plan A was to push hard and stop if pain emerged; Plan B was to run conservatively and speed up if pain-free. I thought I was executing Plan B, but my heart-rate data told a different story—178 bpm in the first half and 167 bpm in the second half suggests I was actually running Plan A!

### Nutrition Strategy 🥤⚡

My fueling strategy worked well. I drank Maurten 320 Drink Mix 3 hours before the race, ate a GU gel 1 hour before, then took 1 Maurten caffeinated gel and 1 regular Maurten gel 5 minutes before the start. During the race:

- Mile 3: 1 gel
- Mile 6: 1 caffeinated gel
- Mile 9: 1 gel
- Mile 12.4: 1 caffeinated gel (from aid station)
- Mile 15: 1 gel (from aid station)
- Mile 18: 1 caffeinated gel (from aid station; picked up two extras to carry)
- Mile 21: 1 gel
- Mile 23.5: 1 gel

For electrolytes, I took 6 SaltStick capsules throughout: with breakfast (3 hours pre-race), at the race start, and at miles 5, 9, 15, and 21. I skipped two water stations but used all the others for Gatorade or water. No cramping! 💪

### Mental Game 🧠

I encouraged myself throughout the race. On flat stretches with no one ahead, I briefly closed my eyes to breathe, scan for any pain, and reset. That mindfulness kept me connected to my body.

After I finished and got my phone back, I recorded voice memos to capture details while they were fresh. That habit proved invaluable for writing these reflections.

### Race Day Logistics 🧢🧊

I slept well Saturday night because I had made peace with potentially dropping out if the injury risk was too high. That mental acceptance reduced pre-race anxiety.

My Xtep 160 Pro shoes performed excellently—a fellow runner even complimented them and said he learned about the brand from the 3rd-place finisher at the 2025 Sydney Marathon.

Post-race recovery started immediately: I got back to the hotel by 11:15 AM and took a 45-minute ice bath while posting about my experience on social media.

## What I Can Improve 🔧

### Pre-Race Nutrition 🍞

I experienced abdominal discomfort near my liver from miles 0–6 and again from mile 24 to the finish. I suspect the fatty croissant I ate at 4:30 AM was the culprit. According to Harris Wu, fats and proteins take longer to digest than pure carbohydrates. Next time, I’ll stick with bread or a bagel.

The smoked fish I ate for protein and salt may have contributed to small watery bowel movements. I’ll be stricter next time—just eggs, salt, and rice for dinner the night before the race.

### Pre-Race Recovery 🛠️

No deep-tissue massage close to race day! The massage-gun session Friday night (two nights prior) caused significant tightness in my left hip flexor on Saturday, making me seriously consider dropping out. The Biofreeze patches also caused some skin irritation.

### Equipment Issues ⌚️

Both my COROS watch and Harris Wu’s COROS required an additional “Resume” tap during the race, causing incorrect pacing for that segment. This seems to be a common issue for COROS users.

I didn't need sunglasses despite the sunny weather—the buildings blocked most sunlight, and I felt more energized without them. My visor provided sufficient sun protection. 🧢



## Memorable Moments ✨

> "When it quiets down—the crowd, the pain, the self-doubt—that is when the real race starts."

I met a Chinese running creator, [瑟瑟跑步](https://www.youtube.com/@wsarthur/videos), who checked my time using my bib number. He was excited about his 2:39 Personal Record (PR), having just run 2:43 in Berlin three weeks earlier. He asked about my PR, and I shared my 2:38 from the Xiamen Marathon earlier this year. I regret not taking a photo with him—I was cold and rushing to change. 📸

At the [ChiRunners](https://chirunners.wordpress.com/) party the day before the race, I ate plain rice and some hard-boiled eggs I brought from home, and I enjoyed chatting and taking photos with my Dallas friends there.

Right after the race, I noticed I bounced back faster than many other runners who struggled to walk, especially downstairs. My training clearly paid off. ✅

The race showed me the full spectrum of marathon reality—some runners even peed publicly to save time. Not always glamorous! 😅

## Final Thoughts 🏁

This marathon taught me that success isn’t just about the finish time—it’s about learning, adapting, and respecting your body’s limits while pushing its boundaries. Every race is a laboratory for improvement, and I’m grateful for these lessons as I continue my running journey. 🧪


When I got home from Chicago, my wife said a $200 check from the Sioux Falls Marathon (Sep 21, 2025) had arrived for my overall 3rd-place finish—my first-ever prize money. 🥉💵🙌
